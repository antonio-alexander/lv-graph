# lv-graph/lv-graph-global

lv-graph is a collection of VIs that simplify interactions with XY graphs in LabVIEW; mostly dealing with managing the data. It contains two packages lv-graph and lv-graph-global.

## lv-graph

lv-graph contains a handful of VIs that provide functionality to manage data displayed within an XY graph via paging and decimation. It has a number of functions that provide the ability build the graphs in a single plot, multi-plot of vertical plots.

## lv-graph-global

lv-graph-global provides an implementation of a functional global using a dvr and a handful of api to provide the ability to manage data with a single X axis.
